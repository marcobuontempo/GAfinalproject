# ***T2 Task Planner (GAfinalproject)***
- This is a group project as part of "Generation Australia's" Web Development program.


## **Description**
- The primary purpose of this project is to provide users with a website Task Planner.
- It allows tasks to be created by users and displayed back to them in a "card" format.
    
- ### Features
    - Create new tasks
    - Update existing tasks
    - Delete existing tasks
    - Form validation (to help prevent mistakes when creating task)
    - Filter displayed cards by status (To-Do, In-Progress, Review, Done, or Show All)
    - Persists data between sessions (saves tasks to local device, so tasks can remain existent after refreshing/closing webpage)


## **Installation**
- HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript were used to create this website.
- The website has been deployed through Github Pages, so simply open in browser (https://marcobuontempo.github.io/GAfinalproject/).
- Use a modern browser (i.e. Chrome) for best experience.


## **Usage**
- ### Create Task
    - Sidebar -> "Create" button -> Fill in details -> "Save Task" button

- ### Update Task
    - Click on existing task card -> Fill in details -> "Save Task" button

- ### Form Validation
    - When submitting form, ensure that:
        1. 'Title' is 5+ characters long
        2. 'Description' is 5+ characters long
        3. 'Assigned To' is 3+ characters long
        4. 'Due Date' is not empty
        5. 'Task Status' is not empty
    - Invalid fields will prevent the user from submitting the task

    - Alternatively, Click on existing card -> Click on "Delete Task" -> Confirm
